**Algorand Wallet Transfer Utility**

This tool is designed to allow the quick and automated transfer of assets from one wallet to another.

This will NOT transfer or remove empty assets by design as these assets should be reviewed to make sure you are not staking them somewhere and to prevent the accidental removal of a needed asset for retrieval.

If after using this you need to remove empty assets, use the Bulk ASA Opt-Out tool created by Kinn: https://www.kinn.info/out


**Getting Started**

Install Python
Go to the Python website at www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

Once the download is complete, double-click the installer file and follow the prompts to begin the installation process.

In the installer, make sure to select the "Add Python X to PATH" option, where X is the version number of Python you are installing. This will ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable, which makes it easier to run Python from the command line.

**Install the Python SDK**
To install the Algorand Python SDK, you can follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check if Python is installed by typing "python" in your terminal or command prompt. If you get an error message, you may need to install Python first.

Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to install the Algorand Python SDK using pip, a package installer for Python:
pip install py-algorand-sdk
